# Torque-Wrench-Calculator
Small Java program, uses a GUI to converts a torque setting on a torque change to the proper torque when an adapter is being used. 

While a mechanic in the Marines, sometimes we'd have to torque something using a attachment such as a "crows foot" or "dog bone". However, when it was not possible to torque the 
hardware at a 90 degree angle we'd have to place the attachment facing up, inline with the torque wrench. This would change the torque being applied to the hardware and increased 
the chance of us damaging or breaking the hardware, leading to further maintenance hours. We'd have to use an equation in our publications to convert
the torque being applied to the actual torque. 

This program facilitates doing that computation.
